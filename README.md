# Minimal Mariana — Obsidian Theme Override

A clean CSS snippet that applies a **Mariana-inspired color palette** (based on Sublime Text & VS Code Mariana) on top of the official **Minimal** theme for Obsidian.

This project does **not** replace the Minimal theme. Instead, it provides a **non-intrusive color override**, keeping the layout, spacing, typography, animations, and UX of Minimal — while giving the entire app the distinct Mariana look.
